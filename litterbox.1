.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon logs IRC (over TLS) activity to a database
which may be queried with
.Xr scoop 1 .
Messages, notices, joins, parts, quits, kicks,
nick changes,
topic changes,
bans and unbans
are recorded in the database.
The contents of messages are indexed for full-text search.
.
.Pp
The
.Nm
daemon
may be connected to the
.Xr pounce 1
IRC bouncer alongside regular clients
to provide central logging
and a simple search query interface with
.Fl q .
.
.Pp
The database must be initialized with
.Fl i .
If the database format has changed,
it will be migrated automatically when
.Nm
starts,
or can be migrated explicitly with
.Fl m .
Live backups of the database
can be made with
.Fl b .
Instances of
.Nm
connected to different IRC networks
will share the same database.
.
.Pp
Options can be loaded from
files listed on the command line.
Files are searched for in
.Pa $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/litterbox
unless the path starts with
.Ql / ,
.Ql \&./
or
.Ql \&../ .
Each option is placed on a line,
and lines beginning with
.Ql #
are ignored.
The options are listed below
following their corresponding flags.
